		<h2>	I am a creative mother of one amazing 14 year old, high school freshman and partner to a fabulous software craftsman.  This bootcamp is going to enable me to show my son that anything is possible in life at any 	time.  This will be a sort of second career.  I started out in graphic design and programming only to move more towards print design. I have always been in creative business from the time I was in college to, today.  I look forward to also mentoring other women and girls.  Anything is possible in this life with some patience and determination!
